Analysis scripts and codes for reproducing figures in the manuscript Spatiotemporal neural dynamics of objeccts recognition under uncertainty in humans

Analysis was originally performed on a machine running Redhat Linux v7.8, Matlab R2017a, and Spyder 5.0.5 (Python 3.8).

## Contents

### **Figures/**

Figure2.m plots MEG main task decoding results, RDMs, and MDS shown in Figure 2 (requires Matlab)  
Figure2_supplement.m plots MEG localizer decoding results shown in Supplementary Figure 1 (Matlab)  
Figure3_supplements.m plots MEG-fMRI correlations shown in Supplementary Figures 2-4 (Matlab)  
Figure4A.m plots commonality results shown in Figure 4A (Matlab)  
Figure4B_and_supplments.m plots commonality results shown in Figure 4b and Supplementary Figures 5-7 (Matlab)  
Figure5_and_supplements.py plots ANOVA results shown in Figure 5 and Supplementary Figure 8 (Python IDE)
